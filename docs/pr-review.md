# FlatPark PR review runbook

The maintainer's review process for incoming PRs — primarily new-app and
app-update submissions. An AI agent runs this top to bottom; a human merges.

**How to run it:** for "review PR #N", copy the [template](#review-template) into
your working notes, then work the phases in order, filling one row at a time with
verifiable evidence (command output, `file:line`, a hash, a URL). The output is
the filled template plus a drafted PR comment. **The reviewer recommends only —
it never merges or publishes.**

> **Rule of engagement — never execute untrusted code.** No running `install.sh`,
> manifest `build-commands`, the app, `npm`/`pip`, or any shipped binary/script/
> installer. Static analysis only. Download artifacts as **bytes** into an
> isolated temp dir, inspect before extracting, and run nothing inside. If a
> decision genuinely needs execution to resolve, escalate to a human.

This runbook is the single source of truth; the public
[listing policies](https://flatpark.org/policies/) and the
[publishing guide](https://flatpark.org/contributing/) are audience-tuned
summaries of it. It layers on top of `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` (which
validates descriptors, tests, dead-link-checks, and does a no-secrets fork
build) and the `scripts/audit-descriptor.mjs` guardrails — this runbook owns the
judgment calls CI can't make.

## Provenance-based trust model

License is **not** the trust axis — it is compliance input only. Non-FOSS is
allowed (the registry ships proprietary broker apps), and open-source apps are
often shipped as official prebuilts rather than source builds (e.g. electerm).
What matters is **where the bytes you run come from**. Place each submission in a
tier:

- **Tier 1 — source-built / reproducible / source-verifiable.** Shipped
  interpreted code is byte-for-byte identical to the public source, or the build
  is reproducible from the manifest.
- **Tier 2 — official upstream prebuilt (the dominant case).** The vendor's or
  genuine project's own release, repackaged unmodified. Requires: (1) **official
  download source** — every `extra-data`/`archive` URL on the vendor's official
  domain or genuine upstream repo, not the submitter's account or a mirror;
  (2) **unmodified repackage** — `build-commands` only install the wrapper/
  desktop/metainfo/icon + an `apply_extra` that unpacks the official download; no
  patch/`sed`/recompile of the payload; shipped artifact == what the official
  URL serves. *External* sandbox adaptation is allowed and does not break Tier 2:
  wrapper env vars, a library the runtime lacks (from a shared `flatpark/prebuilt`
  stack or a second `extra-data` source — not a per-app source build into the ref;
  see Phase 3), `PATH` scripts that forward host commands — review those as code,
  since they run. **Code injected into the app process** (an `LD_PRELOAD` shim, a
  patched or replaced upstream file) is not external adaptation: an open-source app
  that needs it is rejected (the fix belongs upstream), and a proprietary app may
  carry it only when its metainfo description says plainly what is injected and why
  (`io.enpass.Enpass`). (3) **pinned bytes** — sha256 (+ size for extra-data).
- **Tier 3 — opaque third-party / submitter-built binary.** Neither
  source-verifiable nor a pinned official-upstream release (PR #13). **Reject.**

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Rules of engagement (safety)
Static-only; nothing executed. Artifacts downloaded as bytes into an isolated
temp dir; inspect-before-extract (traversal/symlink/setuid); extract
`--no-same-owner --no-same-permissions`; run nothing. Read-only `gh`. Execution
needed to decide → escalate to a human.

### Phase 1 — Scope & classification
Classify: new app (`registry/<id>/`) / existing-app change / infrastructure.
**High-scrutiny surface (STOP if a non-owner touches it):** `.github/`,
`scripts/`, `config/`, signing config, and — for an app that **already exists on
the base commit** — its `resolve-update.sh` or `update.command`. These are
CI-executed on a repo-write token (`update-check.yml` runs `contents: write` +
`pull-requests: write`; `check-updates.sh` `eval`s `update.command`).

A resolver added inside a **brand-new** `registry/<id>/` directory is the normal
submission flow, not a high-scrutiny event: every new app must bring one, its
blast radius is that app's own pin, and it only executes post-merge on `main`.
It still gets read as code in Phase 4.2 — the distinction is that a contributor
may bring their own resolver but never edit one the repo already trusts.
Identify the changed app id(s).

### Phase 2 — Submitter & provenance
Account age, history, social graph, other repos, prior contributions. Source-repo
age and corroboration; commit identity (watch for malformed emails); timeline
plausibility (account → repo → release within hours is a red flag). Emit a trust
tier: established / unknown-but-plausible / throwaway-suspicious. Assign the
artifact provenance tier (1/2/3).

### Phase 3 — Descriptor & manifest static review
- **Source pinning, per type:** `git` → immutable `commit` (reject branch/tag
  only); `archive` → `sha256` + genuine-upstream URL; `extra-data` → `sha256` +
  non-zero `size`; `file` → local, reviewed as part of the PR; other → NEEDS-HUMAN.
- **What may land bytes in `/app` (→ R2):** only a shared support stack released from
  [`flatpark/prebuilt`](https://github.com/flatpark/prebuilt) (Ayatana tray,
  `appimage-tools`, mpv/sql/opencv stacks, …), consumed as a pinned `type: archive`
  module. The app payload and any single-app dependency must be `extra-data` (fetched at
  install, never baked into the ref). A per-app `git`/`archive`/remote source built into
  `/app` is an auto-reject; a `buildsystem: simple` module that only `cp`s in-repo
  wrapper/desktop/metainfo files is fine (no remote bytes).
- **finish-args risk scan:** near-auto-reject on escape perms
  (`--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak`, `--filesystem=host`, `--filesystem=/`)
  unless declared in `policy.dangerous_permissions` **with a justification** (then
  it is not an auto-reject but a reviewed exemption → NEEDS-HUMAN, never a silent
  pass); warn on `--device=all`, `--filesystem=home`, needless `--share=network`.
- **Optional capabilities are opt-in, not pre-granted:** a broad permission that
  the app's *core* feature doesn't need must be absent from `finish-args` and
  instead documented as a `flatpak override` command in the metainfo description
  (see `org.electerm.Electerm`). A broad grant kept in `finish-args` needs a
  written justification in the PR body → warn if missing.
- **Local-test attestation:** the PR body states the submitter built, `flatpak
  install`ed, and launched the app, with the core feature exercised and the gaps
  named. Missing → warn (the reviewer never runs it; see Phase 0).
- **`policy:` block vs reality:** `proprietary` accurate; `dangerous_permissions`
  covers the high-risk finish-args actually used (hard enforcement deferred — see
  guardrail G2(b)).
- **build-commands:** read every line; flag network fetch, `curl|bash`, writes
  outside the build dir, and **any modification of the vendor payload/behavior**.
- **source URLs** resolve to genuine upstream (no lookalike / fork).
- **`app-id`** reverse-DNS matches the real vendor (impersonation / typosquat).
- **`update.command`** is a simple relative script path (e.g. `./resolve-update.sh`).
- **[Tier 2]** download host = official vendor domain / upstream, not the
  submitter's personal namespace.

### Phase 4 — Runtime-behavior scan
Grep manifest + shipped scripts + source for runtime fetch-and-exec
(`npm install`, `pip install`, `curl|wget`, `nc`, download-then-run).
**Allowed (vendor self-updater exception):** the vendor's own installer/updater
that downloads into the app's data/cache dir, when packaging does not patch the
official behavior, writes stay in the per-app data/cache dir (no host-home),
endpoints are the vendor's own, and there is no shell pipeline from an arbitrary
URL. **Rejected:** runtime fetch-and-exec of arbitrary/unpinned third-party code
as a core mechanism (PR #13's `npm install peerflix`), or an updater whose
packaging patches official behavior. Review `update.command`/resolve scripts as
code. Note network endpoints and broad filesystem×network combos.

### Phase 5 — Artifact / binary provenance
- sha256 of the artifact == manifest pin.
- **Inspect without execution, per artifact type:** tar/tar.gz/tgz/tar.zst → list
  entries, reject traversal/symlink-escape/setuid; zip → list with zip tooling,
  same checks; deb/rpm → inspect payload without running maintainer scripts
  (review those statically); shell installer (`.sh`) → static review where
  practical, else treat as opaque official prebuilt needing stronger Tier-2
  provenance + human judgment; **AppImage → accepted**: it must be cracked offline,
  never executed — `apply_extra` runs `flatpark/prebuilt`'s `appimage-tools`
  (`appimage-offset` + `unsquashfs -o <offset>`) against the appended SquashFS, with
  **no libfuse and no `./*.AppImage` invocation**. Reject an AppImage recipe that
  runs the stub, wants FUSE, or `--extract`s by executing it.
- **[Tier 1]** shipped interpreted code == public source (byte-diff each file).
- **[Tier 2]** shipped artifact == official download (re-fetch + hash-compare);
  build did not alter the payload.
- Any "official" prebuilt (node, electron, a JRE, …) hash-verified against the
  real upstream (compare code sections / build-id where a canonical artifact
  exists, as done for `node`). From-source builds with no reproducible build →
  NEEDS-HUMAN, not PASS.
- IOC scan: persistence (autostart/cron/systemd/`.bashrc`), miners
  (`xmrig`/`stratum+`), reverse shells (`/dev/tcp`, `nc -e`), hardcoded IPs,
  embedded second ELF, RPATH/RUNPATH injection.

### Phase 6 — Compliance & purpose
Non-FOSS / proprietary is **allowed** — not a rejection reason. Reject only for
purpose/legality: piracy, malware or abuse tooling, trademark-infringing
impersonation, content illegal to distribute.

### Phase 7 — Verdict & report
Decide per the rubric. Produce the filled template and a drafted PR comment.
Reviewer recommends only — a human merges.

## Decision rubric

**AUTO-REJECT (any one):**
- Compliance / legality violation (piracy, malware, trademark, illegal-to-distribute).
- Sandbox-escape permission (`--talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak`, `--filesystem=host`/`/`)
  **not** declared in `policy.dangerous_permissions` with a justification (declared → NEEDS-HUMAN).
- Unpinned / mutable source for its type (git without commit; archive/extra-data
  without sha256; extra-data `size: 0`).
- Tier 3 provenance (opaque third-party / submitter-built binary).
- [Tier 1] shipped code ≠ public source.
- [Tier 2] download source not official, OR packaging patches/recompiles the
  payload, OR shipped artifact ≠ official download. (External adaptation —
  wrapper env, extra library modules, `PATH` scripts — is not a modification;
  review it as code.)
- Code injected into the app process (`LD_PRELOAD` shim, patched/replaced upstream
  file) in an **open-source** app; or in a **proprietary** app without a plain
  metainfo disclosure of what is injected and why.
- AppImage recipe that executes the stub or needs libfuse (offline `unsquashfs` via
  `flatpark/prebuilt` `appimage-tools` is the only accepted path).
- A `type: archive` / `type: git` / remote source landing bytes in `/app` that is **not**
  a shared support stack released from `flatpark/prebuilt`. App payloads and single-app
  dependencies must be `extra-data` — they must not be baked into the ref / shipped from
  R2. (Source-building one app's missing library into `/app` is this reject.)
- Runtime fetch-and-exec of arbitrary / unpinned code as a core mechanism (the
  vendor self-updater exception does not count).
- `update.command` that is not a simple relative script path.
- IOC found (traversal / setuid / persistence / miner / reverse-shell / embedded
  payload / RPATH injection).
- Infra/workflow tampering from an external contributor, or an edit to an
  existing app's resolver (a resolver in a brand-new app dir is not tampering).
- Throwaway account **+** Tier-3 binary (the PR #13 combination).

**NEEDS-HUMAN:** from-source binaries not byte-verifiable · novel permission
needing justification · borderline provenance · unknown source type · shell
installer that can't be statically reviewed.

**PASS:** clean + trusted + provenance verified for its tier.
